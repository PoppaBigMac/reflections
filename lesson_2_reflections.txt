What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository a .git file is created. This new file allows
us to make commits and keep track of the history of the files inside the
directory. We need to do this in order to use a lot of the Git features that
we want to use.




How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different in the way that it works. It is what is in
between looking at the files and commiting the changes. I think the
value that it offers is a way to see what files you will be commiting
before you actually commit and it gives you flexibility to change your
mind if you decide that another way to commit is better.
