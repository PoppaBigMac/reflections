When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository would be great when I want to work with other people
on the same project or I want to take part in an ongoing project. Using a
remote repository, allows many users to contribute to a project without needing
to all be using the same computer.




Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to make sure that the changes that are being pulled are changes that
you want to have on your local repository. This allows a user to avoid getting
unwanted commits and changes. Just like push, you want to have control over
what new data you allow into your repository.




Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are a type of cloning that is done in GitHub. A clone is made of a
repository in GitHub and copied to GitHub. A clones are copies that can be made
locally, and from GitHub to your local computer. Clones are different than
copies because you can have metadate saved that stores the commits made. A
branch on the other hand is when you make two commit path from a single
parent commit. This is useful when you want to experiment with your code without
breaking any of the working files.
