When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository would be great when I want to work with other people
on the same project or I want to take part in an ongoing project. Using a
remote repository, allows many users to contribute to a project without needing
to all be using the same computer.




Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to make sure that the changes that are being pulled are changes that
you want to have on your local repository. This allows a user to avoid getting
unwanted commits and changes. Just like push, you want to have control over
what new data you allow into your repository.
